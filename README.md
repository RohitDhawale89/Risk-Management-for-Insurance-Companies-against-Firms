**Risk Management for Insurance Companies against Firms**

**Problem Statement**
The insurance company faces challenges due to economic crises, resulting in 220 out of 6800 insured IT firms going bankrupt. To improve future strategies, a model is developed to identify firms eligible for insurance. Profits per customer are $1,000, but claims incur a loss of $50,000. With 68,000 potential clients, the company aims to optimize profitability.

**Preliminary Business Problem Solving**
Calculate the potential profit and loss using a null model and assess the need for an improved strategy.

**Data Exploration and Cleaning**
Explore and clean the dataset by checking column names, data types, and handling null values.

**Data Splitting and Imbalance Handling**
Split data into training and test sets. Address imbalances using oversampling.

**Feature Selection and Scaling**
Explore feature correlations, drop unnecessary columns, and scale values for models.

**Model Building**
Build and tune models (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, ADABoost, XGBoost).

**Model Evaluation**
Evaluate models using metrics like recall, accuracy, precision, and F1 score.

**Business Impact Summary**
Assess the business impact of the proposed models. Random Forest demonstrates the best recall (96.67%), resulting in a significant expected profit.

The insurance company can proceed with implementing the proposed model for enhanced profitability, considering the potential impact of imbalanced data.
